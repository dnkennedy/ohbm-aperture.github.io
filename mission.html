        <p></p>
        <p>
          The purpose of Aperture is to enable a diverse approach to sharing and communicating high quality, community-based, open
          neuroscience while bringing transparency and interactivity to the publishing process.
        </p>
        <h2>About Aperture.</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          First conceived in 2017 by the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM), Aperture was created by and for members of
        OHBM to share and promote their research beyond the traditional PDF.
        </p>

        <p>
        The scope of Aperture publications includes traditionally published material such as original research reports, reviews,
        tutorials, and educational materials, but also extends to computational notebooks, interactive plots, software, data,
        and post-publication peer-review to <b>create reusable, and reproducible Research Objects</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Aperture features peer-reviewed works in all areas of brain imaging and assessment, including those at the interface of
        other disciplines, with the goal of elevating research standards and accelerating the dissemination of useful tools and
        information.
        </p>
        <p>
        The platform will operate as an open-access journal with a double-open Peer Review system. However, Peer Reviewers will
        have the option to opt-out of having their identity known to the author at any stage in the review process. Research
        will be published under a Creative Commons Attribution License. There are no submission fees, but authors will be asked
        to pay an Author Processing Charge upon acceptance for publication. Weâ€™ve worked to make our fees very competitive, and
        the fee is reduced for OHBM members.
